    "description": "Allows websites and services to evaluate a user's authenticity without needing to know the user's identity.   With this API, a website/service can issue a batch of Private State Tokens (renamed to Private state tokens from Trust Tokens)  to a user's browser. The tokens are stored on the user's browser and can then be “redeemed” by other sites and services as a signal of the user's authenticity.",

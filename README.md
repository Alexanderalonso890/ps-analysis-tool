Cookie Analysis Tooling for learning, understanding, and preparing for the upcoming deprecation of the 3P cookies and the release of [Privacy Sandbox APIs](https://privacysandbox.com/open-web/#proposals-for-the-web).

# Privacy Sandbox

[Privacy Sandbox](https://privacysandbox.com/) is a multi-year [initiative by Google](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/privacy-sandbox/overview/) for building a more private web by defining a set of building blocks (i.e. proposed APIs) enabling [a new privacy model for the web](https://github.com/michaelkleber/privacy-model). This Initiative encompasses three tracks:

1. Replacing functionality powered by cross-site tracking with privacy-preserving alternatives.

2. Turning down third-party cookies, while  ensuring that the ecosystem has the technical capabilities for embracing new privacy-preserving solutions (e.g. First Party Sets, Topics, etc.)

3. Mitigating workarounds, by ensuring developers have a well-lit path to the new capabilities of the platform, and avoid pursuing tracking via other means.

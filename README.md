Cookie Analysis Tooling for learning, understanding, and preparing for the upcoming deprecation of the 3P cookies and the release of [Privacy Sandbox APIs](https://privacysandbox.com/open-web/#proposals-for-the-web).

# Privacy Sandbox

[Privacy Sandbox](https://privacysandbox.com/) is a multi-year [initiative by Google](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/privacy-sandbox/overview/) for building a more private web by defining a set of building blocks (i.e. proposed APIs) enabling [a new privacy model for the web](https://github.com/michaelkleber/privacy-model). This Initiative encompasses three tracks:

1. ***Replacing functionality powered by cross-site tracking with privacy-preserving alternatives***. Ideally,there wonâ€™t be any difference between how the web of today and the web in a post-Privacy Sandbox world work, except that users will be able to feel confident that the browser is working on their behalf to protect their privacy and when they ask questions about how things work they will like the answers they find.

2. ***Turning down third-party cookies***. Eventually 3P cookies will be removed while  ensuring that the ecosystem has the technical capabilities for embracing new privacy-preserving solutions (e.g. First Party Sets, Topics, etc.)

3. ***Mitigating workarounds***. As the ability of doing cross-site tracking via 3P cookies is removed, we will ensure developers have a well-lit path to the new capabilities of the platform, and avoid pursuing tracking via other means.
